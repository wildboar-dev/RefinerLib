An implementation of Gauss-Newton Gradient Descent

## What is it?

This is an attempt to implement a Gauss-Newton Gradient descent optimiser in C++. The Gauss-Newton algorithm is quite well-known and is documented [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton_algorithm).

## Getting the code working

This algorithm was tested on Ubunto 20.04 with the "vanilla" version of OpenCV installed (4.2.0). To install this version simply open up a terminal and type in the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
```

It is also assumed the cmake and C++ are installed on the machine. 

**NOTE:** That development was done using vscode.
